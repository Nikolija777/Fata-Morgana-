# Fata-Morgana-Effect

My first encounter with scientific research was when I participated in the Serbian Young Physicists' Tournament (when I was in my third year of high school) :blush:

The preparation phase of the competition consisted of investigating different physical phenomena as a team. Since there was not an explicit and exact way to approach problems, we had to come up with our research strategy. We frequently had to familiarise ourselves with new mathematical and physical concepts in order to address the tasks properly. Also, we used programming to obtain the experimental results. For example, in the initial phase of qualification, everyone worked independently on investigating the problem. My choice was the Fata Morgana effect. I focused on occurring this phenomenon when the laser light is directed through the fluid that has the gradient of the density, actually the gradient of refractive index. Then we can observe that the path of the laser light would not be linear, but instead, it bends. To find the dependence of the refractive index on the height in the liquid, I photographed the path of the laser light in the liquid. Using the program (which I typed in the MATLAB), I can determine the given dependence based on the photo :)

:round_pushpin: It was an invaluable experience, which fortified my belief that utilizing knowledge is the best way of learning

I posted a report (which explains in detail the phenomenon and the procedure) and the code (with comments). However, everything is in Serbian language :crying_cat_face:

So if you have any questions, feel free to text me :relieved:
